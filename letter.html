        <h1>My Heartfelt Letter</h1>
        <p>Hello Lara,</p>
        <p>Words cannot express how sorry I am for what happened. I deeply regret my actions and the pain they have caused you. You mean the world to me, and I hope we can find a way to move past this.</p>
        <p>Our memories together are some of the best moments of my life, and I cherish each one. I want to create many more beautiful memories with you and make up for the hurt I caused.</p>
        <p>Please know that I am committed to changing and being a better person for you. You deserve nothing but the best, and I will strive to be the friend who can give you that.</p>
